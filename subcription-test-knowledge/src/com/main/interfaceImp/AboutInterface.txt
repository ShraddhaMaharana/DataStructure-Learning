1) Interface are used to achieve Abstraction, Polymorphism and Multiple Inheritance.

2) In an interface we can use
	constant variable
	static methods
	default methods - are optional and can be implemented at interface level.
	abstract methods
	
3) Interface can't be instantiate.
4) It can be empty i.e without any method or variable.
5) Final word can't used with interface definition.
6) Access modifiers can be used are : public or default. abstract will be added by compiler.
7) Methods present in it can't be private, protected or final.
8) Interface variables are public, static and final. We can't modify its visibility.
9) Abstract class implementing interface will inherit its all (abstract + default) methods. 

Ques) What we can achieve using Interface ?
Ans) Abstraction, Polymorphism, Multiple Inheritance, behavioral functionality.

	a) Behavioral Functionality :
	   Interface can be used to add certain special behavior to unrelated classes. Such interfaces are Cloneable, Comparable, Comparator etc.
	   
	b) Java only support singular inheritance, but by using interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.
	
	c) Polymorphism :- Its ability of an object to take different forms during run time.
